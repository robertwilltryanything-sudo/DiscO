#
# ------------------ SETUP INSTRUCTIONS ------------------
# 1. Repository Settings:
#    - Go to your GitHub repository's "Settings" tab.
#    - In the left sidebar, navigate to "Pages".
#    - Under "Build and deployment", select "GitHub Actions" as the source.
#
# 2. Add Secrets:
#    - In your repository's "Settings", go to "Secrets and variables" > "Actions".
#    - Click "New repository secret" for each of the following:
